## Diamond Model Meta Features

>[!summary]-  Timestamp
>
> This indicates the start and stop time of an event and is an integral part of grouping malicious activity.

>[!summary]-  Phase
>
>This is analogous to steps in the Cyber Kill Chain; malicious activity includes two or more steps executed in succession to achieve the desired result.

>[!summary]-  Result
>
>This delineates what the adversary gained from the event. Results can be documented as one or more of the following: confidentiality compromised, integrity compromised, and availability compromised.

>[!summary]-  Direction
>
> This indicates the direction of the event across the Diamond Model. These include Adversary-to-Infrastructure, Infrastructure-to-Victim, Victim-to-Infrastructure, and Infrastructure-to-Adversary.

>[!summary]-  Methodology
>
>This is used to classify the general type of event, such as port scan, phishing, content delivery attack, syn flood, etc.

>[!summary]-  Resources
>
>These are one or more external resources used by the adversary for the intrusion event, such as software, adversaryâ€™s knowledge, information (e.g., username/passwords), and assets to carry out the attack (hardware, funds, facilities, network access).
