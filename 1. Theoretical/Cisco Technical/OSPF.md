# What is OSPF?

>[!summary] 
>
> - Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a **TCP/IP internet routing protocol**, created by the **Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)**  
> - OSPF Is defined in **[RFC 2328](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2328.txt)**. 
> - OSPF is an **IGP** used to distribute routing information within a single Autonomous System (AS). 
> - OSPF is based on link-state technology.
> - OSPF has introduced many new concepts such as authentication on routing updates, **VLSM**, route summarization and more.
> - More information can be read on **Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)**  **[RFC 2328](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2328.txt)**

# OSPF Features

#### Independent Transport
- OSPF **works on top of IP protocol** and uses **protocol number 89**.
- It does not rely on the functions of any transport layer protocols, either **TCP** or **UDP**
#### Efficient Use of Updates
- When an OSPF router first **discovers a new neighbor**, it **sends a full update** with all known link-state information
- When an OSPF network **is in a converged state** and **a new link comes up** or **a link becomes unavailable**, an OSPF router **sends only a partial update** to all its neighbors.
- This update will be flooded to all OSPF routers within an area
#### Metric
- OSPF uses a **metric** that is based on the **cumulative costs of all outgoing interfaces** from source to destination. The **interface cost is inversely proportional to the interface bandwidth** and can be also setup explicitly.  
#### Update Destination Address
- OSPF uses **multicast and unicast**, rather than broadcast for sending messages.
- The IPv4 multicast addresses used for OSPF are 
	- **224.0.0.5** to send information to **all OSPF routers**
	- **224.0.0.6** to send information to **DR/BDR routers**. 
- The IPv6 multicast addresses used for OSPF are
	- **FF02::5** for **all OSPFv3 routers**
	- **FF02::6** for **all DR/BDR routers**
- If the underlying network does not have broadcast capabilities, you must **establish OSPF neighbor relationships using a unicast address**.
- For IPv6, this address will be a **link-local IPv6 address**.
#### VLSM Support
- OSPF is a **classless routing protocol**. It supports **VLSM** and **discontinuous networks**.
- It carries subnet mask information in routing updates.
#### Manual Route Summarization
- You can **manually summarize OSPF interarea routes** at the **ABR**, and you have the possibility to **summarize OSPF external routes** at the **ASBR**
#### Authentication
- OSPF supports **clear-text**, **MD5** and **SHA** authentication.
