## 2. Types of Evidence

In order of most important to least:

>[!summary]- 1 Best Evidence
> 
> This is evidence that is in its original state. This evidence could be storage devices used by an accused, or archives of files that can be proven to be unaltered.

>[!summary]- 2 Corroborating Evidence
>
>This is evidence that supports an assertion that is developed from best evidence.

>[!summary]- 3 Indirect Evidence
>
> This is evidence that, in combination with other facts, establishes a hypothesis. This is also known as circumstantial evidence. For example, evidence that an individual has committed similar crimes can support the assertion that the person committed the crime of which they are accused.
