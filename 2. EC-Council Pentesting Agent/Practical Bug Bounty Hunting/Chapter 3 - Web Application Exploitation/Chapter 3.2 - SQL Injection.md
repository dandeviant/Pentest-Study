## Method of SQL Injection

1. Blind Injection
	- Situations where no feedback is given on user input.
2. Error-based Injection
	- Situations where some error is outputted when a query is invalid.
## Types of SQL Injection

1. Logical Bypass
	- This involved bypassing some application logic based on a query.
	- Example: Adding `OR 1=1` to a `WHERE` clause
2. Information Leak
	- This involved leaking data from other tables.
	- Exxample: Adding a `UNION` to an existing query.
## Example - Authentication Bypass (Easy)

**Running Queries**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(username) FROM Logins 
WHERE username='@input' 
AND password='@input'
```

**Bypassing Queries**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(username) FROM Logins
WHERE username='administrator' --'
AND password=''
```
