	- Vulnerabilities related to **injecting data that is interpreted as code**.
2. **Broken Authentication**
	- Authentication and session management **implemented incorrectly**
3. **Sensitive Data Exposure**
	- PII and **sensitive data is accidentally exposed** through applications and APIs
4. **XML External Entities (XXE)**
	- XML External Entities leverage **poorly configured XML** to evaluate external entities
5. **Broken Access Control**
	- Exploits related to **poor permission or access handling**
6. **Security Misconfiguration**
	- **Insecure default** configurations, **incomplete** or **incorrect** configuration
7. **Cross Site Scripting (XSS)**
	- Cross site scripting involves **injecting code into the browser through user input**
8. **Insecure Deserialization**
	- Serialization flaws that lead to **remote code executions (RCE)**
9. **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities**
	- Components external to the products loke open source that are **out-of-date**
10. **Insufficient Logging and Monitoring**
	- Attackers being able to **erase logs** or **no logs existing** at all
