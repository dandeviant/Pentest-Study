# Part 1 - Open-source Intelligence (OSINT)

>[!note] What is OSINT?
> The process of gathering information about a target that is publicly available

#### OSINT Tools
- Google, LinkedIn, social media, etc
- **Maltego**

> [!summary]- Personal Notes
> 
> - OSINT can be defined as any information gathering activities/process that utilizes public services such as search engines, social media, etc to find from large to small piece of information
> - Information gathered varies, **depends on what YOU, as a hacker, wants**. Information are such as
> 	- Services public top domain (google.com, kali.org, facebook.com)
> 	- Personal Information
> 		- Phone numbers
> 		- Public Personal Email
> 		- Company, work emails, work location
> 	
> - Play around with tools learned as much as you can, get familiar with the process and what results you will get
# Part 2 - Subdomain Enumeration and `sublist3r`

> [!note]- What is Subdomain Enumeration?
> 
> - **Subdomain Enumeration** is the process of finding all subdomains associated with a top-level domain.
### The `sublist3r` tool

- `sublist3r` can be used to find subdomains for  given domain
- `-d` flag allows you to specify a domain
- `-p` flag allows you to specify ports
- `-v` flag allows you to see verbose output 

```
daniel@kali:~$ sublist3r

                 ____        _     _ _     _   _____
                / ___| _   _| |__ | (_)___| |_|___ / _ __
                \___ \| | | | '_ \| | / __| __| |_ \| '__|
                 ___) | |_| | |_) | | \__ \ |_ ___) | |
                |____/ \__,_|_.__/|_|_|___/\__|____/|_|

                # Coded By Ahmed Aboul-Ela - @aboul3la
    
Usage: python3 /usr/bin/sublist3r [Options] use -h for help
Error: the following arguments are required: -d/--domain

### Notes 

> [!summary] Personal Notes
>
> - `sublist3r` depends on public services, which means it's just another automated Googling done for you
> - And like normal users like us, they are also bound to network policies such as blocked sites and all that
> - Consider all this before deciding on how you want to use `sublist3r`

# Part 3 - Nmap Scans

### About Nmap

> [!note]- What is **nmap**?
> 
> - Nmap (Network Mapper) is used to scan for services and open ports available on web server.

> [!note]- When to use **nmap**?
> 
> - Typically used when the target is a *website* or *web server*.
> - Useful for identifying potential targets running on ports.
> - Useful for identifying technology stacked used by a product

### How to use Nmap?

- Two common methods:
	- GUI based: **Zenmap**
	- Command Line based: **Nmap** (the best one)
- Many different command line arguments exist that are valuable.
#### Scanning Flags
- `-sS` - Determine the state of **TCP port** without fully connecting to the sysrem
- `-sU` - Determine the state of **UDP ports that are accepting requests**
- `-sT` - Determine the state of **TCP ports by connecting to them**
- `-sA` - Uses **TCP ACK** to determine if a **port is stateful or filtered**
#### Host Discovery Flags
- `-Pn` : **Disable pings**, and only scans for open ports
- `-PR` : Performs an **ARP discovery** on a local network
- `-sn` : Performs host discovery but **does not scan any ports**
- `-n` : Will specify to not **try to resolve DNS entries**
#### Port Specification Flags
- `-p` - Used to **specify a port** for scanning
- `-p-` - Specifies to **scan all possible ports** **(typically the DEFAULT OPERATION OF NMAP)**
- `-F` - Does **fast scan** to check common ports quickly
#### Service Flags
- `-A` : Conducts an **aggressive scan** running **several operations at once**
- `-O` : Detects the **operating system** of the target system
- `-sV` : Attempts to **detect service running** on the system
#### Output Flags
- `oN` - Outputs using a **given filename**
- `-oG` - Outputs data in a **greppable format**
- `-oX` - Outputs data in **XML format**
- `-oA` - Outputs **all three formats at once**
