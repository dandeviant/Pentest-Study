#### CPU Components
1. **Control Unit**
	- Retrieving individual instructions from their location in memory, and translate into commands that can be read by CPU
2. **Execution Unit**
	- Perform the third step of the instruction cycle, namely, executing, or performing the operation that was specified by the instruction
	- Made up of several functional components
		- **Registers** are temporarily holding areas in memory for storing data required for processing
		- **Arithmetic/Logic Unit (ALU)** contains electronic circuitry needed to perform arithmetic and logical operations on data in the registers
		- **Floating Point Unit (FPU)** performs arithmetic operations on numbers with decimals, known as floating-point numbers (e.g 1.5)
		- **Multimedia Extensions (MMX)** unit performs special operations associated with graphics, audio or video (mostly bulk operations on a chunk of data)
